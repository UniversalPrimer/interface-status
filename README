The Interface Status program is a Linux C program that gets the status (up/down) and IP address of every network interface on the system. In version 1 of the Universal Primer it will likely be used to select which interface to broadcast over.

Later, this code will facilitate selection of interfaces for an flv stream splitter and recombiner that will split a stream over several connections and recombine them at the server in order to allow broadcasting wirelessly using several bundled 3G / wifi / wimax connections.
